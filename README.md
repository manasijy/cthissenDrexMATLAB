# Drex #

What is it? 
----------------- 
Drex simulates the rotation of crystal orientations and development of preferred orientations in a deforming olivine aggregate.


Motivation
------------------ 
The development of crystal preferred orientations in olivine (and other minerals) has important implications for understanding the dynamics of the earth's interior. Various computer models have been developed to simulate the rotation of crystal orientations in olivine aggregrates, but they have proven difficult to use. This is a version of the popular Drex model, implemented with user-friendliness in mind. 


Requirements
------------------ 
Drex requires Matlab 2014 or later. No additional toolboxes are required to run the program. 


Installation
------------------ 
No installation is necessary.


Usage
------------------ 
The code does not require input arguments and can be run by calling the program in the MATLAB command window or pushing the green "Run" button. User-adjustable parameters can be found in Drex.m. See the Drex.m file for additional information.
